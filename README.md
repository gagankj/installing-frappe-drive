- As ubuntu or MacOs is required to run Frappe Framework, so I installed Ubuntu 22.10 using Multi-boot.
- Then I followed the installation steps from the Frappe official documentation.
- I faced some problems installing it cause may be I missed some warnings or errors.
- I also referred to Youtube video but it did not helped much and again throwed some errors.
- Then after so many tries, I contacted one of the contributors (Abdallah A. Zaqout) through LinkedIn.
