- I used Multi-boot to install Ubuntu 22.10 as installing the Frappe Framework requires either Mac OS X or Ubuntu.
- After that, I followed through the installation instructions from the official Frappe manual --> https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation
- I had some issues installing it since I may have missed certain errors or warnings.
- I also used a YouTube video as a resource, but it was not very helpful and again produced several mistakes.
- Later, after numerous attempts, I got in touch with Abdallah A. Zaqout, one of the authors of Frappe Drive, via LinkedIn.
- I explained to him the issues I was having.
- He sent me the versions of Python, Node, Yarn, and other programmes that I needed to install, so I did so.

- He also included the frappe installation command, which was helpful.
- After installing frappe bench and setting up my drive app, I was successful in running it through the url.
- Then I attempted to upload, share, create, and delete folders (also from trash)
